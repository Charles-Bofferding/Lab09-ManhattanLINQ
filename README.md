## Lab 9 Manhattan LINQ

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a list of objects from a JSON file and then filter through those objects
to pass the relevant information out to the user with the console.


# Operation

There should be no user input required in order for this to run


# Current Status

I am having a problem trying to get the data to read in. After several tries I just tried to build out the 
filtering logic and hope that I can get some help tomorrow after class with the reading of the data.
